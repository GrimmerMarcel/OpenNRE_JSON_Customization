OpenNRE (https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE) takes JSON-Files as input. Many example Datasets derived by Distant Supervision are very large so that processing them leads to problems with ressources. In order to derive JSON-Files that contain subsets of the orignial data the codes from this project should help for Customiziation.
